# Chapter 2: Storytelling with Data

## 2.1 Summary

Incorporating storytelling techniques into data visualization enhances audience engagement and leaves a lasting impression. Building upon the data visualization design principles introduced in Chapter 1, this chapter introduces the concept of visual data storytelling. Through examples, case studies, and academic literature, we define and characterize "narrative visualization." The chapter ultimately guides learners in identifying and applying effective storytelling strategies in data visualization.

### 2.1.1 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students should be able to:

- Understand the importance of storytelling in data visualization.
- Define data visualization storytelling.
- Identify and explain key elements of data visualization storytelling, including:
  - Genre
  - Structure
  - Highlighting
  - Transition
  - Ordering
  - Interactivity
  - Messaging
- Utilize tools and techniques to integrate storytelling into data visualization.

## 2.2 Breaking Data Visualization to Its Basics

Mastering how to tell a story efficiently is one of the hardest skills for a data scientist to develop. The term *Data Visualization* is defined as:

> “The act of representing information as a picture, diagram, or chart, or a picture that represents information in this way.”

Essentially, data visualization aims to craft a story from the dataset, presenting insights in a form that is digestible, appealing, and impactful. While it may not seem as cutting-edge as machine learning, data visualization is a crucial component of a data scientist's work.

In today's data-driven world, data visualization is the lens through which we interpret complex datasets. It allows those unfamiliar with numbers and algorithms to understand complex data narratives efficiently.

Any chart consists of two main components:

### 2.2.1 Data Types

Data is not limited to numerical values; rather, it can take many forms. When visualizing data, it is essential to consider the type of data being represented. Data can be:

- **Quantitative (numerical)**: Continuous or discrete numerical values.
- **Qualitative (categorical)**: Discrete categories, dates, times, or text.

A clear understanding of data types helps determine the most effective visualization method.

### 2.2.2 Encoding Information: The Visual Lexicon

Visual encoding is at the core of data visualization, translating abstract numbers into graphical representations. Although scatter plots, pie charts, and heatmaps may appear distinct, they share a common visual language that transforms data into meaningful insights.

There are two primary categories of encoding:

- **Retinal Encodings**: Shape, size, color, and intensity—elements our eyes recognize instantly.
- **Spatial Encodings**: Position, order, and relative size, leveraging our brain's spatial awareness.

Using multiple encodings in a single visualization can be overwhelming. Simplicity is key—one or two retinal encodings per chart are optimal for readability. Overloading a chart with multiple encodings can obscure the message rather than clarify it.

### 2.2.3 What Works and What Doesn’t?

Choosing the right encoding depends on the story being told. Consider:

- **Continuous data** (e.g., height, weight) is best represented using position on a common scale.
- **Discrete data** (e.g., gender, nationality) is effectively shown using colors or spatial regions.

Several psychological principles help explain why certain visualizations are more intuitive than others.

#### 1. Gestalt Theory

Gestalt Principles explain how the human brain perceives patterns:

- **Similarity**: We group objects with similar attributes (e.g., color, shape, size). Used in heat maps and scatter plots.
- **Closure**: Objects within a boundary appear related. Used in tables and grouped bar charts.
- **Continuity**: Elements aligned in a sequence appear connected. Used in line charts.
- **Proximity**: Objects close together are perceived as a group. Used in scatter plots and network diagrams.

#### 2. The Principle of Proportional Ink

Graphical elements should be proportional to the values they represent. This principle, proposed by Bergstrom and West, ensures that visual elements (e.g., bars, shaded areas) are consistent with their corresponding data values. Misleading visualizations often violate this principle, especially in media and financial reports.

## 2.3 Storytelling and Data Visualization

Storytelling and data visualization complement each other since storytelling principles apply to most communication activities (Dahlstrom, 2014). Effective storytelling makes data visualization more engaging and memorable (Kwan-Liu Ma et al., 2012). Unlike traditional storytelling, data visualization storytelling replaces linear narrative elements (such as characters and settings) with data-driven context (Segel & Heer, 2010).

Lee et al. (2015) outlined three key components of a visual data story:

1. A sequence of story elements presenting data-driven insights.
2. Visualizations supporting each key message, supplemented with annotations or narrations.
3. A meaningful sequence of story elements to maximize the storytelling objective.

The structured arrangement of data elements ensures that viewers are guided through insights rather than left to draw conclusions independently. This distinction separates data visualization storytelling from exploratory data visualization, which lacks a predefined narrative structure.

## 2.4 Case Study: Privacy Policies Visualization

A notable example of effective data visualization storytelling is an article by Litman-Navarro (2019) in *The New York Times*, titled *"We read 150 privacy policies. They were an incomprehensible disaster."* The author used data visualizations to transform a complex, text-heavy topic into a compelling narrative.

Key storytelling techniques used in the article include:

- A compelling opening statement and graphic to engage the audience.
- A slide-like progression of visualizations presenting key insights.
- Annotations and labels for context.
- Interactive elements enabling deeper exploration.
- Effective ordering of story elements to build a coherent narrative.

The article's visuals effectively highlight the complexity and length of privacy policies, comparing their readability to well-known books and tracking their changes over time. Through these strategies, the article makes a dry legal subject engaging and accessible.

## 2.5 Conclusion

Effective data visualization storytelling requires deliberate design, balancing aesthetics and functionality. The principles discussed—including Gestalt Theory, proportional ink, and encoding strategies—help ensure that data visualizations effectively communicate insights.

Good data visualization isn’t just about presenting numbers; it’s about crafting a compelling narrative. By making data accessible, engaging, and meaningful, we bridge the gap between raw information and real-world insights. As data professionals, our responsibility is to present data in a way that informs and inspires action.

# Information Visualization in Python

Information Visualization is the process of transforming raw data into visual representations (charts, graphs, plots, etc.) to make data easier to understand and interpret ([Lecture 9 Data Visualizations - Data Visualization using Matplotlib , Seaborn and Plotly What is - Studocu](https://www.studocu.com/row/document/iqra-university/human-computer-interaction/lecture-9-data-visualizations/115839904#:~:text=Data%20visualization%20in%20Python%20refers,Python%20programming%20language%20libraries%20and)). Effective visualization reveals patterns, trends, and outliers that might be hidden in raw numbers. In Python, a rich ecosystem of libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc.) enables creating a wide variety of static and interactive visualizations. This lecture will cover both theoretical and practical aspects of data visualization, focusing on common chart types and how to create them using Python's popular libraries.

## Why is Data Visualization Important?

- **Enhanced Understanding:** Visualizing data helps in grasping trends and relationships quickly ([Lecture 9 Data Visualizations - Data Visualization using Matplotlib , Seaborn and Plotly What is - Studocu](https://www.studocu.com/row/document/iqra-university/human-computer-interaction/lecture-9-data-visualizations/115839904#:~:text=)). Complex datasets can be understood at a glance when represented visually.  
- **Effective Communication:** Charts and graphs communicate insights to others (including non-technical audiences) more effectively than raw data ([Lecture 9 Data Visualizations - Data Visualization using Matplotlib , Seaborn and Plotly What is - Studocu](https://www.studocu.com/row/document/iqra-university/human-computer-interaction/lecture-9-data-visualizations/115839904#:~:text=)).  
- **Identifying Outliers:** Visualizations make it easier to spot anomalies or outlier points that might indicate errors or special cases ([Lecture 9 Data Visualizations - Data Visualization using Matplotlib , Seaborn and Plotly What is - Studocu](https://www.studocu.com/row/document/iqra-university/human-computer-interaction/lecture-9-data-visualizations/115839904#:~:text=non)).  
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Clear visuals support informed decision-making by highlighting key data insights ([Lecture 9 Data Visualizations - Data Visualization using Matplotlib , Seaborn and Plotly What is - Studocu](https://www.studocu.com/row/document/iqra-university/human-computer-interaction/lecture-9-data-visualizations/115839904#:~:text=%23%23%204.%20Data)).  

By leveraging visualization, data scientists and analysts can tell a **data story**, guiding viewers through insights in a compelling way.

## Python Libraries for Data Visualization

Python offers several libraries for creating visualizations, each with its strengths:

- **Matplotlib:** A foundational library for static plots. It is highly flexible, supporting a wide range of plot types (line, bar, scatter, histograms, etc.) and fine-grained customization ([Lecture 9 Data Visualizations - Data Visualization using Matplotlib , Seaborn and Plotly What is - Studocu](https://www.studocu.com/row/document/iqra-university/human-computer-interaction/lecture-9-data-visualizations/115839904#:~:text=1)). Matplotlib is often considered the “granddaddy” of Python visualization – powerful but sometimes low-level ([Advanced Visualization Techniques with Python](https://toxigon.com/advanced-visualization-techniques-with-python#:~:text=with%20Matplotlib%2C%20Seaborn%2C%20and%20Plotly,some%20of%20the%20most%20popular)).  
- **Seaborn:** Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a higher-level interface for attractive statistical graphics ([Lecture 9 Data Visualizations - Data Visualization using Matplotlib , Seaborn and Plotly What is - Studocu](https://www.studocu.com/row/document/iqra-university/human-computer-interaction/lecture-9-data-visualizations/115839904#:~:text=2)). It comes with built-in themes and color palettes, making it easy to create visually appealing charts with less code. Seaborn excels at complex plots (e.g., distribution plots, heatmaps) and automatically handles many details (like error bars, regression lines).  
- **Plotly:** A library for **interactive** visualizations. Plotly (especially with its high-level module Plotly Express) allows you to create charts that you can zoom, hover, and pan in. It’s great for web-based dashboards and interactive data exploration ([Lecture 9 Data Visualizations - Data Visualization using Matplotlib , Seaborn and Plotly What is - Studocu](https://www.studocu.com/row/document/iqra-university/human-computer-interaction/lecture-9-data-visualizations/115839904#:~:text=3)) ([Advanced Visualization Techniques with Python](https://toxigon.com/advanced-visualization-techniques-with-python#:~:text=with%20Matplotlib%2C%20Seaborn%2C%20and%20Plotly,some%20of%20the%20most%20popular)). By calling `fig.show()`, Plotly spins up an interactive chart in a browser. Plotly figures can also be embedded in Jupyter notebooks or exported as HTML for sharing.

Other libraries include **Bokeh** (interactive, web-friendly) and **Altair** (declarative plotting), but in this lecture, we will focus on Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly as our primary tools.

## Types of Visualizations

There are many ways to visualize data. Choosing the right chart depends on the data type and the story you want to tell. Below, we discuss common visualization types, their uses, and how to create them in Python. We will use shared sample datasets (like the **Tips** dataset or **Iris** dataset) for demonstration. Each section includes examples in Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly, as appropriate.

### Line Plots

A **line plot** displays data points connected by straight lines. It’s typically used to show trends over a continuous interval or time series ([Line chart | Python & Matplotlib examples](https://python-graph-gallery.com/line-chart/#:~:text=A%20line%20chart%20displays%20the,used%20to%20represend%20time%20series)). For example, you might use a line chart to show how a stock price changes over time or how a sensor reading varies.

 ([Matplotlib Line Plot - Tutorial and Examples](https://stackabuse.com/matplotlib-line-plot-tutorial-and-examples/)) *Figure: A simple line plot showing a trend over six periods. Each point is connected to visualize the change or trend ([Matplotlib Line Plot - Tutorial and Examples](https://stackabuse.com/matplotlib-line-plot-tutorial-and-examples/#:~:text=This%20results%20in%20a%20simple,line%20plot)) ([Matplotlib Line Plot - Tutorial and Examples](https://stackabuse.com/matplotlib-line-plot-tutorial-and-examples/#:~:text=plt)).*  
Line plots are ideal for **time series data** or any scenario where data points have a natural order. In Python, creating a line plot is straightforward. With Matplotlib, you can use the `plt.plot()` function:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data for demonstration
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
y = [1, 5, 3, 5, 7, 8]  

plt.plot(x, y)            # Plot a line connecting the points in order
plt.title("Line Plot Example")
plt.xlabel("Period")
plt.ylabel("Value")
plt.show()
``` 

In the example above, the x-axis might represent a sequence (e.g., time periods 1 through 6) and the y-axis is the value at each period. The resulting plot (as shown in the figure) has points connected by a line, making it easy to see the overall trend (in this case, an upward trend with a dip at period 3). By default, Matplotlib will draw a straight line between points in the order they are given.

**Seaborn** also allows line plots (e.g., `sns.lineplot`) which can automatically compute confidence intervals if provided with raw data. **Plotly** can create interactive line charts using `px.line`; this is useful when you want to hover to see exact values or zoom into specific ranges.

**Use cases:** Line plots are best for **continuous data** over an interval – e.g., tracking changes over time, trends, or continuous processes.

### Bar Charts

A **bar chart** represents categorical data with rectangular bars. Each bar’s length is proportional to the value it represents. Bar charts are great for comparing quantities across categories ([Matplotlib Bar Plot - Tutorial and Examples](https://stackabuse.com/matplotlib-bar-plot-tutorial-and-examples/#:~:text=Bar%20graphs%20display%20numerical%20quantities,are%20for%20the%20different%20categories)) – for example, comparing sales numbers for different products or counts of occurrences for different categories.

 ([Matplotlib Bar Plot - Tutorial and Examples](https://stackabuse.com/matplotlib-bar-plot-tutorial-and-examples/)) *Figure: A simple vertical bar chart with three categories (A, B, C) on the x-axis and their values on the y-axis ([Matplotlib Bar Plot - Tutorial and Examples](https://stackabuse.com/matplotlib-bar-plot-tutorial-and-examples/#:~:text=import%20matplotlib)) ([Matplotlib Bar Plot - Tutorial and Examples](https://stackabuse.com/matplotlib-bar-plot-tutorial-and-examples/#:~:text=The%20relationship%20between%20these%20two,plt.bar)).*  
In the figure above, each bar corresponds to a category (“A”, “B”, “C”) and the height shows the value for that category. Bar “B” is the tallest, indicating it has the highest value among the three.

Creating a bar chart in Matplotlib can be done with `plt.bar()` for vertical bars (or `plt.barh()` for horizontal bars). For example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

categories = ['A', 'B', 'C']
values = [3, 5, 4]

plt.bar(categories, values, color=['steelblue', 'orange', 'green'])
plt.title("Bar Chart Example")
plt.xlabel("Category")
plt.ylabel("Value")
plt.show()
```

This code will produce a bar chart with three bars. We specified a different color for each bar for clarity. Matplotlib’s bar chart requires the categories (x-coordinates) and their corresponding values (heights). We also add labels and a title for readability.

**Seaborn** provides a higher-level `sns.barplot` which can directly plot data from a DataFrame, computing means and confidence intervals if needed. **Plotly** has `px.bar` for interactive bar charts (you can hover over bars to see values, etc.). Bar charts can also be grouped or stacked to show sub-categories (e.g., sales by product broken down by region).

**Use cases:** Use bar charts for **comparing quantities across discrete categories**. For example, comparing survey responses, counts of different types, or aggregated statistics per group. If the categories have an inherent order (like age groups), a bar chart still works, though sometimes an ordered bar (or a line if continuous) might be chosen.

### Scatter Plots

A **scatter plot** displays individual data points as dots on a two-dimensional plane, with one variable on the x-axis and another on the y-axis. Scatter plots are used to examine the relationship or correlation between two numerical variables ([Matplotlib Scatter Plot - Tutorial and Examples](https://stackabuse.com/matplotlib-scatterplot-tutorial-and-examples/#:~:text=,features%29%20of%20a%20dataset)). Each point represents an observation.

 ([Matplotlib Scatter Plot - Tutorial and Examples](https://stackabuse.com/matplotlib-scatterplot-tutorial-and-examples/)) *Figure: A scatter plot showing the relationship between house size (Living Area) and house price. Each point is a house; the upward trend suggests a positive correlation (larger houses tend to cost more) ([Matplotlib Scatter Plot - Tutorial and Examples](https://stackabuse.com/matplotlib-scatterplot-tutorial-and-examples/#:~:text=fig%2C%20ax%20%3D%20plt,House%20Price)) ([Matplotlib Scatter Plot - Tutorial and Examples](https://stackabuse.com/matplotlib-scatterplot-tutorial-and-examples/#:~:text=We%20need%20to%20supply%20the,Running%20this%20code%20results%20in)).*  
In the scatter plot above, the x-axis is “Living Area Above Ground” and the y-axis is “House Price.” We can see points trend upward, indicating that houses with more living area generally have higher prices (though with some variability). Scatter plots often reveal correlations, clusters, and outliers in data.

To create a scatter plot in Matplotlib, use `plt.scatter(x, y)`. For example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example data: Living area (sq ft) vs Price ($) for houses
area = [1400, 1600, 1700, 1900, 2200, 2400, 3000, 3600]  # living area
price = [250000, 300000, 320000, 340000, 420000, 450000, 500000, 600000]  # price

plt.scatter(area, price, color='teal')
plt.title("House Price vs Living Area")
plt.xlabel("Living Area (sq ft)")
plt.ylabel("Price ($)")
plt.show()
```

Each point in this plot represents one house. If the points seem to rise together (as in this case), it suggests a positive correlation between area and price. If points were scattered with no pattern, it would indicate little to no correlation. Scatter plots are also useful to detect outliers (e.g., a house that is much more expensive than others of similar size).

**Seaborn** offers `sns.scatterplot` (which can add regression lines via `sns.lmplot`) and makes it easy to encode a third variable by color or marker style (`hue`, `style` parameters). **Plotly**’s `px.scatter` creates interactive scatter plots; you can even animate scatter plots or use tooltips to show more info per point.

*Tip:* You can extend scatter plots by adding a third dimension: **color** or **size** of points to represent another variable. For example, using color to denote different categories (species, regions, etc.) or size to indicate weight or magnitude can add more insight. We’ll see an example of this with Plotly’s interactive features.

**Use cases:** Scatter plots are best for **bi-variate data** – to check if two variables might be related (correlation). For instance, height vs weight of individuals, study time vs exam score, or any two metrics you suspect might have a relationship.

### Histograms

A **histogram** shows the distribution of a single numerical variable by grouping data into “bins” (ranges) and plotting bars for the number of observations in each bin. It helps answer questions like: How is the data spread? Is it symmetric, skewed, bimodal? ([Matplotlib Histogram Plot - Tutorial and Examples](https://stackabuse.com/matplotlib-histogram-plot-tutorial-and-examples/#:~:text=In%20this%20tutorial%2C%20we%27ll%20take,data%20falls%20in%20that%20range)).

 ([Matplotlib Histograms](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_histograms.asp)) *Figure: A histogram of a dataset (heights, for example) approximating a normal distribution. The x-axis is divided into bins (ranges of the variable), and the height of each bar shows how many data points fall into that range.*  
In the above histogram, the data (e.g., heights in cm) is grouped into intervals. Taller bars mean more data points in that range. We can see the distribution is roughly bell-shaped: most values are around the center (~170), and fewer at the extremes (around 140 or 200).

Creating a histogram in Matplotlib is done with `plt.hist()`:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Generate 250 data points ~ Normal distribution (mean=170, sd=10)
data = np.random.normal(170, 10, 250)

plt.hist(data, bins=10, color='purple', edgecolor='black')
plt.title("Histogram of Heights")
plt.xlabel("Height (cm)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()
```

This will divide the data into 10 bins and plot the frequency of data in each bin. The choice of bin count (and bin edges) can significantly affect the appearance of the histogram; too few bins might oversimplify the distribution, while too many bins might make it noisy. In practice, you may need to adjust `bins` to reveal the underlying shape well ([Matplotlib Histogram Plot - Tutorial and Examples](https://stackabuse.com/matplotlib-histogram-plot-tutorial-and-examples/#:~:text=Here%2C%20the%20movie%20bins%20,and%202020)).

**Seaborn** provides `sns.histplot` and `sns.displot` which add conveniences like kernel density estimates (KDE) over the histogram or easily faceting by category. **Plotly**’s `px.histogram` can create interactive histograms where you might adjust bin sizes dynamically.

**Use cases:** Use histograms to **inspect distributions** of continuous data. For example: distribution of ages, income, test scores, or any single variable. They help in understanding central tendency, spread, and whether the distribution is normal, skewed, uniform, multimodal, etc.

### Box Plots (Box-and-Whisker)

A **box plot** summarizes the distribution of a dataset by showing its median, quartiles, and any outliers. Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR – 25th to 75th percentile), the line inside the box is the median (50th percentile), and “whiskers” extend to cover most of the rest of the distribution, with points beyond the whiskers plotted individually as outliers ([Matplotlib Box Plot - Tutorial and Examples](https://stackabuse.com/matplotlib-box-plot-tutorial-and-examples/#:~:text=In%20this%20tutorial%2C%20we%27ll%20cover,plot%20Box%20Plots%20in%20Matplotlib)) ([Matplotlib Box Plot - Tutorial and Examples](https://stackabuse.com/matplotlib-box-plot-tutorial-and-examples/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99ll%20begin%20by%20importing%20all,more%20accurately%2C%20the%20PyPlot%20module)). Box plots are great for comparing distributions across multiple groups.

 ([Box and Whisker Plot (seaborn example) – Musings by FlyingSalmon](https://flyingsalmon.net/box-and-whisker-plot-seaborn-example/)) *Figure: Box plots of total bill amounts at a restaurant, grouped by day of the week (Thu–Sun). Each box shows the distribution of bills for that day. We can compare medians (the horizontal line in each box) and variability across days.*  
In the figure, each box corresponds to a day’s total bill distribution (from the classic **Tips** dataset). For example, Sunday’s box (red) has a higher median line than Thursday’s (blue), indicating larger bills on Sundays on average. The boxes’ heights show the IQR (spread of the middle 50% of values), and the “whiskers” extend to roughly 1.5×IQR from the box (a common default) – points beyond that are plotted individually (they would be potential outliers).

To create a box plot in Python: 

- **Matplotlib** has `plt.boxplot`. You provide a list of data arrays (one for each box you want). For example, `plt.boxplot([data1, data2])` would draw two boxes. However, Matplotlib by itself doesn’t add category labels by default – you must specify them via `plt.xticks`. 
- **Seaborn** greatly simplifies box plots with `sns.boxplot(x=..., y=..., data=...)`. If your data is in a DataFrame, you can specify a categorical column for `x` and a numeric column for `y`, and Seaborn will draw a separate box for each category. For instance, `sns.boxplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips)` will produce a plot like the one above (boxes for each day). Seaborn automatically handles labeling and styling.

Example with Seaborn:

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")  # load example dataset
sns.boxplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips, palette="Set2")
plt.title("Total Bill Distribution by Day")
plt.show()
```

This would draw box plots of total bills for each day in the dataset, using different colors for each day (Set2 palette). We immediately see which day has higher or more variable bills.

Box plots succinctly show **median** (Q2), **quartiles** (Q1 and Q3), and **outliers**. If the median line is not centered in the box, the distribution might be skewed. For example, a median closer to the bottom of the box suggests a right-skew (a long tail on the higher end). Outlier points indicate individual cases far from the typical range; in the tips data, maybe a particularly large bill on Saturday shows up as a dot beyond the whisker.

**Plotly** can create interactive box plots (`px.box`). An interactive box plot might allow you to filter categories or see exact quartile values on hover.

**Use cases:** Use box plots to **compare distributions** across categories. For example, comparing test scores between different classes, or salaries across different departments, or any scenario where you want to see differences in median and spread between groups. They are especially useful when you have multiple datasets to compare side by side.

### Other Visualization Types

In addition to the above fundamental chart types, there are other visualizations worth knowing:

- **Histograms vs. Density Plot:** A density plot (or KDE plot) is a smoothed curve approximation of a histogram. Seaborn’s `sns.kdeplot` or `sns.displot(kde=True)` can overlay a smooth distribution line, which is useful for visualizing the probability density of a continuous variable.

- **Violin Plot:** A violin plot is like a combination of a box plot and a density plot. It shows the distribution shape (through width) for each category, along with medians. This can reveal nuances in the distribution that a box plot might miss (like bimodality). In Seaborn, `sns.violinplot` is available.

- **Heatmap:** A heatmap represents values in a matrix form using color intensity. One common use is a **correlation matrix** heatmap, which shows correlation coefficients between many variables, colored from say blue (low or negative correlation) to red (high positive correlation). Seaborn’s `sns.heatmap` can plot 2D arrays or matrices of values. Heatmaps are also used for visualizing frequency tables or geospatial data (when you have latitude/longitude grids, etc.).

- **Pair Plot (Scatterplot Matrix):** This is a grid of scatter plots for each pair of variables in a dataset, plus histograms on the diagonal for individual distributions. Seaborn’s `sns.pairplot` (or Plotly’s `px.scatter_matrix`) is useful for exploratory data analysis to see all pairwise relationships at once (like exploring a dataset with multiple variables such as the Iris flower dataset with sepal and petal measurements).

- **Pie and Donut Charts:** Pie charts show parts of a whole as slices of a circle. They are best used sparingly for a small number of categories where proportions are very different. Python can create pies via `plt.pie` or Plotly’s `px.pie`. However, be cautious – pie charts can be hard to read precisely; bar charts are often a better choice for comparing values. Donut charts are just pie charts with a hole in the middle (often used for aesthetics or to display a total in the center).

- **Line and Area Variants:** Besides basic lines, you might encounter **area charts** (like a line plot with the area under the curve filled with color) to emphasize volume. Stack plots (stacked area charts) show multiple time series contributions stacking up. Matplotlib’s `stackplot` or Plotly’s `px.area` can create these.

Each type of visualization has a purpose. A key part of the **theory of data visualization** is knowing which type of chart is appropriate for the data and message. For example, use a **bar** or **pie** for composition of categories, a **line** for trend over time, a **scatter** for correlation, a **histogram/box** for distribution, and so on. Always consider what insight you want the audience to gain, and choose the simplest visualization that conveys it.

## Practical Example: Matplotlib vs Seaborn vs Plotly

To solidify our understanding, let’s consider a scenario and see how each library can be used. Suppose we have a dataset of **iris flowers** (a famous dataset with measurements of petal and sepal dimensions for three species of iris). We want to visualize how sepal length relates to sepal width, and differentiate the species.

- **Matplotlib:** We can use `plt.scatter` for a basic scatter. We’ll manually color-code points by species and add a legend:
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  # Assume iris_data is a DataFrame with columns: sepal_length, sepal_width, species
  species = iris_data["species"].unique()
  colors = {"setosa": "blue", "versicolor": "orange", "virginica": "green"}

  for sp in species:
      subset = iris_data[iris_data["species"] == sp]
      plt.scatter(subset["sepal_length"], subset["sepal_width"], 
                  color=colors[sp], label=sp)
  plt.xlabel("Sepal Length (cm)")
  plt.ylabel("Sepal Width (cm)")
  plt.legend()
  plt.title("Iris Sepal Dimensions (Matplotlib)")
  plt.show()
  ```
  This produces a static scatter plot. Each species' points have a different color, and the legend indicates which is which. We had to write a loop and manage colors manually.

- **Seaborn:** We can achieve the same plot more succinctly:
  ```python
  import seaborn as sns
  sns.scatterplot(data=iris_data, x="sepal_length", y="sepal_width", hue="species")
  plt.title("Iris Sepal Dimensions (Seaborn)")
  plt.show()
  ```
  Seaborn automatically handles the coloring by species and adds a legend. The result is a nicely styled static plot showing the clustering of species in sepal size space.

- **Plotly:** For an interactive version:
  ```python
  import plotly.express as px
  fig = px.scatter(iris_data, x="sepal_length", y="sepal_width", color="species",
                   title="Iris Sepal Dimensions (Plotly)")
  fig.show()
  ```
  This will open an interactive chart (in a Jupyter notebook or browser) where you can hover over points to see exact values and species, zoom into clusters, and toggle species on/off from the legend. 

Each library produces a scatter plot conveying the same basic information, but Plotly’s is interactive, and Seaborn’s comes out-of-the-box with nice aesthetics. Matplotlib required a bit more code for labeling but offers full control. **The choice of library** can depend on whether you need interactivity or publication-quality static images or if you want to quickly explore data with minimal code.

## Interactive Visualizations with Plotly

One of the advantages of Plotly is the ease of creating interactive visuals. Interactivity can add a layer of depth to data exploration – users can hover to get detailed values, zoom into regions of interest, filter data by clicking legend items, and more.

For example, consider again a scatter plot of two variables with a third variable encoded by color:

 ([Plotly Scatter Plot - Tutorial with Examples](https://stackabuse.com/plotly-scatter-plot-tutorial-with-examples/)) *Figure: An interactive Plotly scatter plot (static screenshot) with points colored by a third variable (“output”). A tooltip is shown for one point, displaying its values (cholesterol, heart rate, etc.) on hover. The color bar indicates the mapping of colors to the output value.*  
In this Plotly scatter (from a heart health dataset), points are colored from purple to yellow based on the value of an `output` variable (say 0 = purple, 1 = yellow). The hover tooltip (shown in the image for one point) displays the point’s details: cholesterol level, max heart rate, sex, age, and output. In an interactive setting, you could hover over any point to see its details, or zoom into dense clusters to examine them more closely. The color legend (“output”) on the right helps interpret the colors.

To produce such a plot:
```python
import plotly.express as px

df = pd.read_csv('heart.csv')  # heart health dataset
fig = px.scatter(df, x='chol', y='thalachh', 
                 color='output', hover_data=['sex', 'age'],
                 color_continuous_scale='Turbo', 
                 title="Cholesterol vs. Max Heart Rate (Interactive)")
fig.show()
```
A few things happen here:
- `color='output'` tells Plotly to color-code points by the `output` column (perhaps indicating heart attack risk, 0 or 1). Plotly automatically produces a color scale (in this case we chose `'Turbo'` colormap for a vibrant purple-yellow range) and a color bar.
- `hover_data=['sex', 'age']` means when you hover on a point, it will show the values of those columns (sex and age) in addition to the x, y, and color variables.
- The resulting figure allows dynamic interaction: tooltips as shown, and you can zoom/pan. If `output` were categorical, clicking legend entries could show/hide categories.

Plotly can create **interactive versions of almost any plot**: line charts where you can hover to see coordinates, bar charts where clicking on a bar could filter data (when combined with Dash for instance), 3D plots you can rotate, maps you can pan/zoom, and even animations (for example, a scatter plot that plays over time).

### When to Use Interactive Plots?

Interactive plots are excellent for **exploratory data analysis** and for **presentations/dashboards** where the viewer might want to delve into the data. For example, in a web dashboard showing sales data, an interactive time-series plot allows the user to zoom into a specific month. However, for printed reports or static media, Matplotlib/Seaborn static plots are more appropriate.

In summary, Plotly (and libraries like Bokeh or Altair) add interactivity at the cost of being slightly heavier (requiring a web render). Matplotlib and Seaborn produce static images ideal for reports. Often, analysts will explore data with interactive plots and then finalize findings with static plots in reports.

## Best Practices for Effective Visualizations

Regardless of library or chart type, keep in mind some general best practices:

- **Clear Labels and Title:** Always label your axes and add a title or caption. The viewer should immediately understand what the plot represents (e.g., units of measurement, what the variables are). For example, use `plt.xlabel("Year")` and `plt.ylabel("Sales (USD)")` rather than leaving axes unlabeled. A descriptive title helps too.

- **Proper Scaling:** Choose appropriate scales (linear, log) for your data. If one data point is extremely large, a log scale might represent the data more informatively. Avoid distorting axes; for instance, starting a bar chart’s y-axis at a non-zero value can exaggerate differences – generally, start at zero for bar charts to accurately show proportions.

- **Avoid Unnecessary Complexity:** Use the simplest chart that conveys the information. Pie charts for too many categories, or 3D charts for data that is essentially 2D, can confuse more than enlighten. Aim for clarity over flashiness.

- **Color and Style:** Ensure sufficient contrast and consider color-blind friendly palettes (Seaborn’s default and Plotly’s default are usually fine). When encoding categories by color, limit the number of distinct colors to a reasonable number (legend with 10+ categories becomes hard to read).

- **Legends and Annotations:** Include a legend when there are multiple categories or variables. Annotate interesting points if it helps (Matplotlib’s `plt.annotate` or Plotly’s hover can serve this purpose).

By following these practices, your visualizations will not only be correct but also effective and professional.

Finally, remember that creating visualizations is an iterative process. You might start with a simple plot, then refine it by adjusting bins, adding trend lines, splitting by category, etc., until it reveals the insight you're after. Practice using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly on various datasets to become proficient in choosing and customizing the right visualization for the task.

## Self-Assessment: Multiple Choice Questions

   A. Matplotlib  
   B. Seaborn  
   C. Plotly  
   D. NumPy  

2. **What type of plot would best show the distribution of a single continuous variable (e.g., the distribution of ages in a class)?**  
   A. Scatter Plot  
   B. Histogram  
   C. Line Chart  
   D. Pie Chart  

3. **In a box plot, what does the line inside the box represent?**  
   A. The mean of the data  
   B. The median of the data  
   C. The range of the data  
   D. An outlier in the data  

4. **You have a dataset of car models with their engine size (numeric) and fuel type (petrol/diesel/electric). Which visualization is most appropriate to compare engine sizes across fuel types?**  
   A. Line plot  
   B. Histogram (one for each fuel type)  
   C. Box plot grouped by fuel type  
   D. Scatter plot with engine size vs. fuel type  

5. **Seaborn is built on top of which library, inheriting its underlying plotting functions?**  
   A. Pandas  
   B. Matplotlib  
   C. Plotly  
   D. Bokeh
